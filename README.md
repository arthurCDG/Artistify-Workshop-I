# Artistify Workshop I

This group workshop will walk you through the steps to create a fullstack application.

You guessed it : Artistify is a **CRUD** application where users are separated in 2 roles :

- admin (logged in users)
- visitor

**Admin users** can **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate and **D**elete resources in a database:
- artists
- labels (records company)
- styles (music genres)
- albums

**Visitor users** can browse/search the collection and comment on artists/album pages.

We will also implement other cool features:

- image upload
- signup/signin/signout
- form validation
- flash messages
- route protection via custom middlewares
- custom hbs helpers
- simple search engine
- AJAX widget(s)

**Work as a team, communicate, splits tasks, avoid git conflicts !**

## Day I - Mission C.R.U.D (end @ 13h00)

Today, we will focus on the CRUD part : let's start coding the dashboard !

This group of pages represents the admin section of Artistify.  
For this early developement phase, we won't protect the dashboard : the signup/signin will come later.

**Don't worry** if you can't finish all the steps : you will get a soluce proposal.

**Do your best : Happy hacking !**

### Todos

- repo forking/cloning + git collaboration settings
- setup .gitignore
- setup .env
    - PORT 
    - MONGO_URI = mongodb://localhost/artistify
    - CLOUDINARY_NAME
    - CLOUDINARY_KEY
    - CLOUDINARY_SECRET
- install required dependencies
- write package.json dev script
- connect your database
- create a seed file for each resource type
- code separated routers setup
- **CRUD artists / labels / styles** (recommended order: Read (if you have a seed file) / Delete / Create / Update)
- views: create the dashboard pages (more details below)
- implement image upload for artists and labels
- **_Advice_** : code some **basic** styling first, improve **later**

### Base routes

The base router is located in /routes/index.js .

| Route         | HTTP | View                | Description                 |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `/`           | GET  | index.hbs           | Display home page           |
| `/dashboard ` | GET  | dashboard/index.hbs | Display dashboard main page |

<br/>

Below, an image of the dashboard main page.  
For each resource type (artist, label, style), 2 views are linked :
- one form to insert new resources in database
- one table listing all documents
    - one update link per line
    - one delete link per line (linked to a view with an update form)
